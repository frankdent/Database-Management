-- Working with areas. The following queries are based on the census_division table.
-- 1. Listing the census divisions with their corresponding areas in hectares.
-- I am showing the ids because some census divisions have the same name
SELECT cd.cdname AS census_division, cd.cduid as census_division_id,
