-- 1. Count the number of airports across Canada by province / territory.
-- 	  Order the result set by count in descending order.

SELECT pt.pname AS province_name, COUNT(a.airport_name) AS airport_count
FROM transcan.airport a, statscan.province_territory pt
WHERE ST_Within(ST_Transform(a.airport_location::geometry, 3348), pt.boundary)
GROUP BY pt.pname
ORDER BY airport_count DESC;
-- This query returns a count of the number of airports per province in
-- descending order. Note that we are using EPSG:3348 here.

-- 2. Count the number of airports in BC where the service provided is only
-- 	  "Control Tower".

SELECT pt.pname AS province_name, COUNT(a.airport_name) AS airport_count
FROM transcan.airport a, statscan.province_territory pt
WHERE ST_Within(ST_Transform(a.airport_location::geometry, 3348),
				pt.boundary) AND
	a.service = 1 AND pt.pname = 'British Columbia'
GROUP BY pt.pname;
-- This query returns a count of the number of airports in BC where the service 
-- provided is only "Control Tower". Note that we are using EPSG:3348 here.

-- 3. Count the number of airports in Quebec where the service provided 
--    includes "Control Tower".

SELECT pt.pname AS province_name, COUNT(a.airport_name) AS airport_count
FROM transcan.airport a, statscan.province_territory pt
WHERE ST_Within(ST_Transform(a.airport_location::geometry, 3348),
				pt.boundary) AND
	pt.pname = 'Quebec' AND	a.service != 2
GROUP BY pt.pname;
-- This query returns the number of airports in Quebec where the service
-- provided includes "Control Tower". Note that we are using EPSG:3348 here.

-- 4. Calculate the distance between St John's Intl and Vancouver International
--    in kilometres.
-- We use geography type when spatial data is dispersed widely across the world
-- When two geography types are passed in to the ST_Distance function 
-- it knows to calculate a great circle distance not a linear distance.
-- Airport locations are already of geography type and in EPSG:4617, which is
-- a geodetic datum.

SELECT ST_Distance(a.airport_location,
				   b.airport_location) / 1000 AS distance_km
FROM transcan.airport a, transcan.airport b
WHERE a.airport_name = 'St John''s Intl' AND
	b.airport_name = 'Vancouver International';
-- The distance between St John's Intl and Vancouver International is using
-- this method is 5022.692607896431 km. The airport locations are of type
-- geography and we are using EPSG:4617

-- 5. Calculate the distance between St John's Intl and Vancouver International
--    in kilometres.
-- We have to cast the airport locations into the geometry type and change the
-- coordinate system from EPSG:4617 to the projected coordinate system EPSG:3348
-- which will give a linear distance.

SELECT ST_Distance(ST_Transform(a.airport_location::geometry, 3348),
				   ST_Transform(b.airport_location::geometry, 3348)) / 1000 AS
				   distance_km
FROM transcan.airport a, transcan.airport b
WHERE a.airport_name = 'St John''s Intl' AND
	b.airport_name = 'Vancouver International';
-- The distance between St John's Intl and Vancouver International is using
-- this method is 4966.111349793799 km

-- 6. The De Havilland Dash 8-400 has a range of 1878 km. Assuming it needs the
-- Control Tower service at an airport, which airports can it fly to from
-- Halifax Robert L. Stanfield International? Give the airport names, distance
-- from Halifax in km and the service name.

SELECT a.airport_name,
	ST_Distance(a.airport_location, hfx.airport_location) / 1000 AS
	distance_from_halifax_km, s.service_name
FROM transcan.airport a, transcan.airport hfx, transcan.service s
WHERE ST_DWithin(a.airport_location, hfx.airport_location, 1878000) AND
	a.airport_name != 'Halifax Robert L. Stanfield International' AND
	hfx.airport_name = 'Halifax Robert L. Stanfield International' AND
	s.identifier = a.service AND
	s.service_name IN ('Control Tower', 'Control Tower / Flight Service Station') 
ORDER BY distance_from_halifax_km;
-- This query returns all the airports 1878km from halifax airport where
-- there is a control tower ordered by closest distance from Halifax. Assuming
-- the one in Halifax is unavailable, the closest Control Tower is at 
-- Charlottetown airport with a great circle distance of 164.62856247189 km. We
-- are using the great circle distance because it makes more sense that a plane
-- travels along a sphere than taking the linear distance. We are also using 
-- the EPSG:4617 coordinate reference system.
